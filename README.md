==============================================
stripe says stripe.charges api is the old method.
stripe.paymentIntents is the unifying method.

had to put

<script src="https://js.stripe.com/v2/"></script>

in html to remove cors

styled components bad because doesn't highlight when selecting similar names. also have to scroll far up just to see imports. and no auto complete. just put css in a different file.

redux bad because cant console.log. just use context.

react stripe checkout is hard to customize.
